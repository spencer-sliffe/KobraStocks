STEP BY STEP GUIDE TO THE LIFE CYCLE OF OUR NOTION CODING TICKETS 
				
Step 1: Branch Creation
	Create a new branch from main
	Name the branch the same as the ticket on notion
		Example: T-2 Revise existing AI Models

Step 2: Completing the ticket
	Move the notion ticket to the proper status
		Example: ready for front/backend -> front/backend in progress
	Open the branch locally
	Make your changes to complete the ticket locally
	Make sure the edits are clean and no unnecessary edits were made

Step 3:	Committing the changes to the branch
	The initial commit should be named the same as the branch name
		Example: T-2 Revise existing AI Models
		Note: Commits after the intial can be named something different
	In the description, briefly describe the changes that were made
	Then commit and push the branch

Step 4: Creating a Pull Request
	Open github in your browser and go to the repo
	Notice the notification at the top of repo saying your branch has recent changes 
		Click the green compare & create pull request button
	On the pull request page
		Make sure the title of the PR matches the Name of the notion ticket
		Your commit description should show up in the PR description
		If everything looks good then create the PR
	Move the Notion ticket to the Code Review status
		Example: front/backend in progress -> Code Review
	
Step 5: Code Review
	A member of our team will review the code in the PR
	If the reviewer see revisions that need to be made while reviewing
		The reviewer will request changes on the portions of the PR that need changed
		The reviewer will move the Notion ticket to correct status
			Example: Code Review -> Ready for backend/frontend
		You will then complete the revisions to resolve these changes
			Do this by repeating steps 2-5
	Upon a reviewer approving your PR
		Merge the pull request into main
		Delete the branch
	Move the notion ticket from the code review status
		if this is the first time this ticket has had a PR merged
			Status movement: Code Review -> Ready for QA
		if this is the second time this ticket has had a PR merged
			Status movement: Code Review -> Done

Step 6: QA
	Move the notion ticket to the QA status
		Example: Ready for QA -> QA
	We as a team will meet for ticket QA
		Use/test the feature(s) added with your ticket
		Scrutinize the functionality of the feature(s)
		Example questions:
			How could this feature be improved
			Does it complete all the tasks needed
			Can the code be more efficient
			Can we reduce the number of database queries
		Report our findings onto the ticket as new tasks
		Move ticket to correct status
			If new tasks
				QA -> Ready for front/backend
				Then repeat steps starting at step 1
			If no new tasks
				QA -> Done
